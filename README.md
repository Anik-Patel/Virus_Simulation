# Virus_Simulation
A simple simulation that shows how people get infected from virueses.
A blue dot is healthy
A red dot is infected
A black dot is dead

Each dot has a 80% chance of becoming immune and that chance goes up depending if it is near healthy dots
They have a 1% chance of getting infected if they are near other infected dots
They have a 1% chance of dying when infected


 Just run the main file
 :)
